### Problem A: Houda and labyrinth game

- **Author** : Mehdi
- **Description**:
  - Given a 2D matrix with cells containing `0` and `1` answer two types of queries: make a given cell `1`, and tell if
    it's possible to reach the bottom row from the top row going only by adjacent white cells .

- **Solution**:
  - One approach is to update evey cell, and do a `dfs` for every query to answer the second type of query, and this will timout
  - Another approach was to consider every cell in the grid as a node in a graph that has no edges and link every adjacent
    `1` cell using a `Disjoint set` and you can answer the second query by checking if the top row and the last row are in the
    same connected component . in the worst case this will timeout .
  - The intended approach is a slight optimization of the above, make two that aren't part of the grid, one at the top and the other at the bottom . and check if those two are in the same connected component . check the illustration two get it .
